I am currently in the Sundaresan lab at UC Davis studying how rice roots assemble a microbiome. One of my main long-term goals is to develop a microbiome-informed agronomy taking into account the evolutionary and ecological complexity of how plants and microbiota dynamically interact. 

Some of my research interests include:

- The rhizosphere effect and plant immune interactions with microbiota.
- The symbiosis spectrum of the root microbiome: pathogens, commensals, and mutualists.
- Microbiome dynamics specific to agricultural systems.

## Experience
#### Research Assistant (PI: Venkatesan Sundaresan)  
<sup>Plant Biology Department, UC Davis; 2018 - present </sup>  
Investigating the rice (_Oryza sativa_) root microbiome, how plants assemble their root microbiome.

#### Research Assistant (PI: Ann M. Hirsch)    
<sup> MCDB Department, UCLA;  June 2015 - June 2017 </sup>  
Investigated symbiotic plant-microbe interactions in the _Medicago_ root nodule microbiome. Using aseptic technique, microscopy, nucleotide extraction, PCR, and sequencing to examine functional and phylogenetic diversity of soil, rhizosphere, and root nodule bacteria. Annotated and performed bioinformatic analysis of bacterial genomes, using curated databases such as JGI IMG-Expert Review, KEGG, CAZy, KOG, and Pfam to make functional predictions for subsequent in vitro validation. Conducted statistical data analysis and created graphics in R.
