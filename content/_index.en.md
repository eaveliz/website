I am currently working on a doctorate in the Plant Biology Department at UC Davis. I am researching the plant microbiota and in particular how root microbiomes assemble from agricultural soils. My research focuses on processes and mechanisms that can provide useful information towards developing appropriate tools for a sustainable intensification of agriculture.
