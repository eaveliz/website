## Research Goals and Interests
My long-term goal is to develop a microbiome-informed agronomy taking into account the evolutionary and ecological complexity of plant-microbiota interactions.

My interests include:  

- The rhizosphere effect and plant immune interactions with microbiota.  
- Microbial roles in biogeochemical cycles (e.g.,nitrogen and carbon).  
- The symbiosis spectrum of the root microbiome: pathogens, commensals, and mutualists.  
- Microbiome dynamics in agricultural systems.
